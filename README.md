# Bootstrap Demo

We learnt about Bootstrap today, one of the most popular CSS Frameworks. We explored the commonly used Bootstrap classes, and then used some of the commonly available components to create a Pokedex type of webpage.

## Using

This project uses:
- Alerts
- Cards
- Carousels
- more coming soon...

## Known bugs

The nested carousels are causing an issue.
